Version 2.5.0.412
- Build: Update make-release.cmd script to use Visual Studio 2015 as source for the publishing task.
- DB: Add update function for new SQL schema, which supports longer item effect strings.
- Import: Implement Item-DB online update for Broadswords Item-DB.
- Config: Prepare config XML files to handle new items from Broadsword Item Database (includes also corrections for old config problems).
- UI: Fix rendering of TMItemSlot text with line breaks, which caused the control to be stuck in an infinite re-rendering loop. Also improved the performance with rendering background for TLabels by not recreating the Graphics object for every sibling control.
- UI: Fix selection or searching of ComboBox items by its displayed label text.
- UI: Fix rendering of invisible Controls which overlaps any TLabel.
- IDE: Update Solution to Visual Studio 2015 to support more libraries and newer TargetFrameworkVersion. Change TargetFrameworkVersion to version 4.5.

Version 2.5.0.411
- Build: Add scripts to the repo to automate the creation and publishing of hotfixes.
- Core: Move CloseXml() into finally clause for stability.
- Core: Fix bug in CItem.Save, where weapons without attributes (shields) tried to substring an empty string.

Version 2.5.0.410
- Build: For now, support only Visual Studio 2010 in build scripts. The default publish target also creates the missing files, now.
	* It uses special MSBuild tasks to create the publish web page and copy the build results to the final publish folder. All publish tasks needs that the property "VisualStudioVersion" is correctly specified on the command line, because the automatic version is almost always false.
- Build: Add scripts to the repo to automate publishing new releases and notes for it.
	* The make-release.cmd script only creates and updates the release branch and merges it back into devel branch. To actually publish this release, you need to create a pull request from this branch for the master branch and let it merge.
- Build: Define exe file version with auto generated code based on the ApplicationVersion.
	* Add MSBuildTasks NuGet package for the build tasks needed for this.
- UI: Show full version info in app title bar and in the about window.

- Config: Add more available races for many classes.
- Config: Add new and move current active servers to the top of the list.
- UI: Use new URL for the wiki pages. As in the past, this is only user created content, so don't take it as reliable information or facts about DAoC, but as orientation for better decisions.
- Core: Fix reading from StreamReader. Unlike std::istream::eof(), EndOfStream doesn't reflect the state when the stream was read past the end, but only if the current read position is at the end. Also, if StreamReader doesn't normalize line endings do it in the read loop.
- Core: Fix normalization of line endings in StreamWrapper and use string.Split() instead of string.Replace() for better performance.

Version 2.5.0.409
- UI: Fix the problem, that attributes without over-caps did not use ToA cap as their absolute limit.
- Config: Revert cap changes on over-cap resists, because TMCapView needs a stable limit (which is not to far away from base cap) for better visual representation. But for the records, mythical resist caps theoretically have no limit.

Version 2.5.0.408
- UI: Correct calculation and display of attribute caps and over-caps based on statements of Broadsword. see: https://darkageofcamelot.com/article/friday-grab-bag-11032017

- IDE: Update Moras.Net.csproj to silence the changed files dialog.
- Core: Specify the supported CLR version in app.config.
- Core: Use a static non-generic helper class when creating the cached default constructor delegate for ObjectAsValue<T>, so reflection is done only once and not for every new generic type parameter.
- Core: Create and use a helper class for the construction of objects from generic type parameters. The new() constraint can be realy slow because it uses Activator.CreateInstance<T> for reference types.
- Perf: Use SuspendLayout() in constructor of TfrmManageDB for better performance, because the layout engine don't need to be stressed this early on the construction of the object.

- Report: Implements support for mythical item slot in reports and change config reports and short reports to include them. This fixes #5. Fixes bugs with inconsistent line endings if reports are copied to clipboard.
- Core: Initialize strFileName to empty string for CPlayer, as long there is no null check wherever it is used. Fix bugs in XML save routines. (It is not a complete or correct XML implementation, but enough for Moras right now. This needs a complete overhaul in future to actually support the XML format. Just use the implementation from .Net-Framework for this.)
- Core: Correct the sequences of Open() & Close() and respectively SetActive(true) & SetActive(false) on SQLiteCommands, so that SQLiteDataReaders are only active at times they are actually used. (Fixes Database locks on idle time.) Actually use unique strPosId (as mentioned in comment) in SQLiteDBCorrection instead of ambiguous strPosClass.
