    <p><b>Menu - Database</b><br>
      <br>
      <img src="images/bm25.png" alt="database"><br>
      <br>
      This menu item is responsible for managing the item database<br>
      <br>
      <b><span style="color: #3333ff;">Import&gt;</span></b><br>
      <b>1) Mora's ...</b><br>
      Import a database in the format of this program. Databases of older
      versions can also be imported.<br>
      <b>2) Leladia 2.0</b><br>
      Import item data intended for Leladia's Spellcraft Calculator. Since in
      this format each object is in a single file, a multiple selection (press
      Shift or Strg) is possible in the file selection dialog.<br>
      <img src="images/bm17.png" alt="arrow">&nbsp;<b>Note</b>:
      Weapons can not be imported here, as some of the information required by
      the program is not contained in the data.<br>
      Armor is always imported as fabric armor. This must be changed at a later
      date.<br>
      <b>3) Kort's SCC</b><br>
      Import item data required for Kort's Spellcrafting Calculator. Here, too,
      each object is stored in an extra file, which is why a multiple selection
      is also possible here.<br>
      All references to Leladia also apply here, so no arms imports and armor
      only as fabric armor.<br>
      <b>4) ChatLog</b><br>
      Imported items from the chat log file created by DAoC. Only items that
      have been moved via the item description (Shift + I) in the chat log file
      will be imported. When importing, there may still be a few dialogues in
      which various missing information is still requested.<br>
      <br>
      <b style="color: #3333ff;">Manage ...</b><br>
      Opens a dialog for managing the <a href="Dialog_manage_database.html">item
        database</a>. Items can be deleted, even edited to a small extent, and
      exported.<br>
      <b><span style="color: #3333ff;"><br>
          Status...</span></b><br>
      Displays various data on the current item database.</p>
