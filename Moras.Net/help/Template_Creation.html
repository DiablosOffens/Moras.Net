    <p><b>How can I create such a stupid configuration (template)?</b><br>
      <br>
      Then I want to give a short guide. As an example, we create an Albion
      weapon master named Schuhplattner for the first Battleground (BG1).<br>
      <br>
      <b style="color: #3333ff;">Step 1: Player information</b><br>
      First some important information about the player for which a
      configuration is to be created.</p>
    <p><img src="images/bm0.png" alt="player information"> </p>
    <b style="color: #3333ff;">Step 2: Create Armor</b><br>
    <img src="images/bm1.png" alt="armor creation">
    <p>After that we click on "Create armor". </p>
    <p>However, the tubular plate offered is too expensive for us, which is why
      we switch to mithril plates. The AF field should now read 50 and Bonus
      should read 15%. </p>
    <p>We accept this armor with Ok.</p>
    <p><b style="color: #3333ff;">Step 3: Set weights</b><br>
      <img src="images/bm2.png" alt="Weights set"></p>
    <p>Next we set the weights. </p>
    <p>Resistances don't interest us at all in BG1, which is why we set all 9
      sliders to 0. </p>
    <p>We want a small gunsmith who works with polearms that deal slashing
      damage. That's why we're setting the Strike, Thrust, and Greatsword
      sliders to 0, as well as the Crossbow slider. S</p>
    <p>ince we might also need a shield to ward off an intrusive archer, we set
      the shield slider to 50%.</p>
    <p>We have now set the basic things.</p>
    <p><b><span style="color: #3333ff;">Step 4: Find Drop Items</span></b><br>
      The first thing we should do is gather some gear for the location that we
      can't have a player craft.<br>
      Let's start with a cat. </p>
    <p>A double click on the neck rectangle opens the <a href="Dialog_search_for_item.html">search
        dialog</a>. </p>
    <p>There really isn't a good chain for the level, I used the "Necklace of
      Perseverance" which increases stat by 12 for a benefit of 8. </p>
    <p>As shown in the Location/Origin field, it's a quest reward, so it's
      pretty easy to get.</p>
    <p>Now do the same with the cloak (double click on cloak). Here my choice
      falls on the "disembodied cloak", which according to the description drops
      at the skeleton centurions in Cornwall. The same for the rest of the
      jewelry.</p>
    <p>Jewel -&gt; Skull Totem<br>
      Belt -&gt; Belt of the Crypt Devourer<br>
      Rings -&gt; Keltoi Ranger Ring, gobling-forged ring<br>
      Wrists -&gt; Goblin Bracer of Speed, Zudd's Rogue Bracer.</p>
    <p>Our values ​​should then look like this:<br>
      <img src="images/bm3.png" alt="Drop items"></p>
    <p><b style="color: #3333ff;">Step 5: Create a Weapon</b><br>
      <img src="images/bm4.png" alt="Weapon creation"></p>
    <p>Next we want to create a proper weapon.</p>
    <p>To do this, we click on the position for two-handed weapons and activate
      the adjacent box.<br>
      After that we change the weapon type to polearms. In the field to the
      right I then set halberd, a very slow polearm with slashing damage. </p>
    <p>Platinum is chosen as the material.</p>
    <p><b><span style="color: #3333ff;">Step 6: Banishing</span></b><br>
      <img src="images/bm5.png" alt="bonus"></p>
    <p>Now let's get down to business. We banish the weapon. To do this, we
      activate the Bonuses tab.<br>
      <br>
      <img src="images/bm6.png" alt="bonuses points"></p>
    <p>As you can see in the picture, our weapon has 14 imbue points, none of
      which are occupied at the moment. Haven't chosen any effects yet. </p>
    <p>First, we want to apply an effect that increases polearm skill. For this
      we set the effect type to skills for effect 1. For effect, we then choose
      polearms. As a value we set 2, which requires 5 IP. We don't need to
      adjust the quality and leave it as it is. </p>
    <p>The line should then look like the following graphic.<br>
      <img src="images/bm7.png" alt="effect1"></p>
    <p>Then we choose 3 more effects. I chose cut, strength and hitpoints here.
      Then we adjust the strength of the effects so that we don't exceed the
      existing 14 imbue points.<br>
      It looks like this for me:<br>
      <img src="images/bm8.png" alt="effects"><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      The whole thing can now also be done for all armor parts, which I would
      like to do without here.</p>
