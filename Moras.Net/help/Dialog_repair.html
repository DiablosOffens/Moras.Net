      This dialog is only available in Crafter mode. It is called about Create
      ... in the <a href="Program_item_bonuses.html">bonus tab</a> of the main
      page.<br>
      <br>
      <b><span style="color: #3333ff;">Jewelry</span></b><br>
      Here the banner wizard sees the jewels needed for the item, can stop and
      uncheck the number of attempts at creation he has already made. If he
      takes into account the production time in the <a href="Dialog_pricing_model.html">price
        model</a>, he can enter this in the time field. However, he can also
      have the timer executed automatically with the stopwatch symbol.</p>
    <p><b><span style="color: #3333ff;">Material (expected)</span></b><br>
      Here, the banning spells are displayed, which are likely to be needed for
      the item. The amount depends on the setting of the field: expected
      attempts.<br>
      <br>
      <b><span style="color: #3333ff;">Material (consumed)</span></b><br>
      Here is the material actually used.</p>
