    <p>The status values ​​gained by items are displayed here.</p>
    <p>Only the values ​​concerning the player are displayed at a time. With a
      gunsmith or warrior no manapool or intelligence, as they do not possess
      these values.</p>
    <p>Behind each value are 2 numbers each. </p>
    <p>The first is the absolute value. In the bracket is the distance to the
      respective <a href="Definition_Cap.html">cap</a>. Values ​​less than 0
      have no further effect on the player and are therefore red.</p>
    <p>A small graphic represents this once again. The thick gray beam
      represents the current value due to its length. The thin bar below
      represents the current <a href="Definition_Cap.html">cap</a>. </p>
    <p>Gray values ​​here are the cap through the player level, white the
      increase due to racial resistances, and green the increase due to an
      object.</p>
