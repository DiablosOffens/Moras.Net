    <p><b>Item - General</b><br>

      <img src="images/bm18.png" alt="current object"></p>
    <p>Here you will find general information about the current object and its
      position.<br>
      <br>
      In the head is the current position, as well as in the case of drop
      objects of the name.<br>
      <br>
      On the far left, the basic type of object is set. These include: <a href="Definition_drop.html">Drop
        item</a>, <a href="Definition_unique_object.html">Unique item</a> and <a
        href="Definition_manufactured_item.html">Crafted item</a>. The <a href="Definition_manufactured_item.html">Crafted
        item</a> option does not appear in all positions, as jewelry items can
      not be produced by a player.<br>
      <br>
      The middle part consists of 3 elements. The largest of these is a large
      text box, which indicates the current configuration. Another element is
      the save button. It only appears when left <a href="Definition_drop.html">drop
        item</a> is selected. This takes over the current item in the item
      database.<br>
      The last item is the:</p>
    <p> <b><span style="color: #3333ff;">Use</span></b><br>
      The usefulness indicates how useful the item is to the player. It is
      calculated as follows:<br>
      <br>
      <span style="color: #009900;">Benefit = Number value of the bonus * Bonus
        multiplier * Weighting (and all bonuses then added)</span><br>
      <br>
      The bonus multiplier depends on the type of effect:<br>
      Status value = 0.666<br>
      Resistance = 2<br>
      Hit points = 0.25<br>
      Manapool = 2<br>
      Focus = 0 (Foki have no direct value)<br>
      Skills = 5<br>
      Caper increases = Corresponds to the underlying value<br>
      Other Bonuses = Capwert des Bonuses / 50<br>
      <br>
      <b><span style="color: #3333ff;">Search ...</span></b><br>
      Call up the search dialog box for the selected position.<br>
      <br>
      <b><span style="color: #3333ff;">Delete position</span></b><br>

      <br>
      <b><span style="color: #3333ff;">Delete effects</span></b><br>
