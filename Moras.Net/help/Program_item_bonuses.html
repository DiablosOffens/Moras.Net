      Here, items desired by players that set the desired bonuses are set.<br>
      <br>
      <b><span style="color: #3333ff;">Effect type:</span></b><br>
      The spell effects are divided into different groups, which can be set
      here.<br>
      <br>
      <b><span style="color: #3333ff;">Effect:</span></b><br>

      The value of the ban spell effect is set here.<br>

      <b style="color: #3333ff;">Quality:</b><br>
      The quality of the effect-related Bann spell jewels is set here. This
      value is actually only of interest to the bane wizard himself. It
      determines how well an object can be <a href="Definition_overload.html">overloaded</a>.<br>
      <br>
      <b><span style="color: #3333ff;">IP (Imbue Points):</span></b><br>
      The Imbue points needed by the Bannzauber Jewel. There are 2 different
      display modes here. In the preset mode, the full imbue points are always
      displayed. In the <a href="Dialog_general_settings.html">options dialog</a>
      you can still switch to half IP. In this mode, only the effect shows the
      full IP that most people need. For the remaining effects, only half the IP
      is displayed. If you add up the IP in this mode, you get the total IP
      required by the item.<br>
      <br>
      <b><span style="color: #3333ff;">Wdhl .:</span></b><br>
