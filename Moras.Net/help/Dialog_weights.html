      Here the weights can be set, i.e. how important a particular value is to a
      player.</p>
    <p>The weighting here largely determines the calculation of the utility of
      an object.</p>
    <p>Classes that can train multiple weapons should set the untrained skills
      to 0, so that items that increase all weapon skills at the same time are
      not unnecessarily highly rated.</p>
