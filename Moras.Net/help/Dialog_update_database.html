      This dialog always appears when a new database is to be imported.<br>
      This can be done by calling the Import functions in the <a href="Menu_database.html">database
        menu</a>, or by calling an online update.<br>
      Closing the dialog with Ok takes over the update in the item database,
      aborting it.<br>
      <br>
      <b><span style="color: #3333ff;">In database:</span></b><br>
      The number of items in the database.<br>
      <br>
      <b><span style="color: #3333ff;">Im Update:</span></b><br>
      The number of items in the file with which the update is performed.<br>
      <br>
      <b><span style="color: #3333ff;">New:</span></b><br>
      So many items from the update file are new.<br>
      <br>
      <b><span style="color: #3333ff;">Updated:</span></b><br>
      So many items from the update file are already in the item database, but
      have updated values.<br>
      <br>
      <b><span style="color: #3333ff;">Status</span></b><br>
      Here is the source of the update file. This is the file name for the
      database import, as well as an Internet link for an online update. An
      online update also states the current state of the file download.<br>
      <br>
      <b><span style="color: #3333ff;">Online update</span></b><br>
      An online update is launched via an entry in the user options. By default,
      no such options are available yet. You can install it through small
      configuration files, which you can download from the corresponding web
      pages and copy to the program directory.<br>
      Further information on the configuration of the configuration files can be
      found in the developer documentation.</p>
