    <p>Overloading is when you load an item with more imbue points, as actually
      possible. </p>
    <p>It is possible to recharge by a maximum of 5 embedding points. </p>
    <p>The probability of a successful recharge depends on the following
      factors: the number of recharge points, the experience of the banner
      wizard, the quality of the item and the band spell jewels.</p>
