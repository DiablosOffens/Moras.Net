      dialog can be called in 3 ways:<br>

      <br>
      The window consists of 3 components. The largest place is in the list of
      <a href="Dialog_item_list.html"> objects</a>. The items found for the
      desired position in the set search options are displayed in it. Further
      information about the currently selected item is displayed on the right.<br>
      Different search options can be set in the lower area. These depend on the
      chosen position.<br>
      A "function" option has a special function. It has 4 options:<br>
      - Drop items: Items are searched from the item database (default setting)<br>
      - This player: Items belonging to the player (carried, in inventory or
      treasure chest)<br>

      You should arrange the search window so that you can see the player's
      values ​​as shown in the image above. This allows you to see in the red
      (The selected item is worse here) or green (here it is better) bars how
      the currently selected item is cut off compared to the previously
      available item.</p>
