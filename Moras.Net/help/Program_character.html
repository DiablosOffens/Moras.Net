    <img src="images/bm16.png" alt="character overview">
    <p>An overview of the player. The objects are arranged in the same way as in
      the game.<br>
      <br>
      <b><span style="color: #3333ff;">Position</span></b><br>
      The current position is provided with a thick white border. If you stay
      with a mouse for a long time over a position, a brief description of the
      object found there is given.<br>
      The positions are marked in color depending on the condition.<br>
      - Gray: Empty or no bonus yet<br>
      - Blue: Drop object<br>
      - Green - Yellow - Red: Current exposure of the object. Green = empty,
      Yellow = Full, Red = Overload, Black = Impossible overload<br>
      <br>
      The gray bar at the lower end indicates how many of the possible 4 ban
      spell effects are evidenced.<br>
      <br>

      <b>Tip</b>: Double-clicking on a position opens the <a href="Dialog_search_for_item.html">search
        dialog</a>.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b><span style="color: #3333ff;">Total use</span></b><br>
      This is the usefulness of all related objects together. The calculation is
      similar to the calculation of the usefulness of an object. The difference
      is that the values ​​that have only actual effect, i.e. only values
      ​​until reaching the <a href="Definition_Cap.html">cap</a>. Caper raises
      directly have no effect here.<br>
      <br>
      <b style="color: #3333ff;">Bann spell prizes</b><br>
      Here, the cumulative prices and costs of all the spell jewels used in the
      configuration are displayed. Costs are always the costs of the raw
      materials needed / consumed.<br>
      Price is the payment required by the band magician. This depends on the
      set price model.<br>
      <br>
      <b style="color: #3333ff;">Report</b><br>
      Here a summary of the current configuration can be displayed / printed.<br>
      See also <a href="Dialog_report.html">here</a>.<br>
      <br>
      <b><span style="color: #3333ff;">Weapon locks</span></b><br>
      There is a special feature with the 4 weapon slots (the 4 positions in the
      row below). Since only certain ones can always be active, you can check
      off the boxes which should be active.<br>
      <br>
      <b><span style="color: #3333ff;">Inventory / treasure chest</span></b><br>
      Here, the items that the respective player has in the inventory or in his
      treasure chest can be entered. Items entered here can then be found in the
      search dialog, also those of other players.</p>
